My twitter parser is made by three classes, MessageReceiver, MessageParser and the parser itself.

The MessageReceiver is responsible for receive the tweet and invoke some classes to parse the message and then return the required parameters.

The MessageParser is responsible to check if all the rules are being respected, if it is, call the Parser to get the parameters.

The parser has only one job, which is recover the parameters from the tweet, these parameters can be an URI a comment or a person comment.

URL's (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to link another websites.

Comments (Identified with '#' are used to comment about an specific topic.

Person comment is used to refer to an specific person.
